Once you have some land surrounding your base you can begin to build towers that can defend you in case of an intrusion by another player. Be careful because other players will try to break into your base and conquer it, if they do all of your land will be taken over and deleted! To be successful in the world of Hexagor.io I¡¯d suggest trying out several builds and ensuring that the land surrounding your home base has a lot of turrets to defend against incoming attacks. When expanding its important to try and gather wood/stone plots early to get supplies for towers, to harvest the resources simply click on a claimed resource plot and it will harvest the supplies.

Travel around space in true zero gravity like fashion, a small amount of boost can go a long way, possibly a bit too long as you can reach high speeds in no time making your sphere hard to control. The moons seem to have their own gravitational pull which can be used to stop your sphere and make it easy to shoot one target without flying off.

In the world of Diep you control a tank and shoot projectiles who¡¯s behaviour can be modified through the levelling system to defend yourself and attack opponents. Every 10 levels you will get the choice to modify your overall vehicle and change the way you shoot/play. Like several other io games there is an in game leader board which displays the players score and an icon of the type of tank they are currently using, I¡¯d recommend that new players pay attention to this to begin with so you can get a better feel for strong tank builds. It is highly recommended that you try to move as much as possible as the higher level tanks deal a lot of damage to new players!

Bloble is an incredibly entertaining 2d strategy game, it pits you in a map with multiple other opponents dotted around the map and its your job to see that they fall. You are given a limited amount of space to build and develop a troop indicated by a dashed circle, within this space you can build 7 types of buildings and upgrade them through the cost of power.
            
            
All buildings can be placed or removed through left clicking, the WASD or arrow keys can be used to navigate the camera and the R key resets your camera back to your base view.

Control: Arrow or WASD keys
Shoot: Space bar
Booster: Shift or Z or M key
Your team is decided when you get into each game field (Left:Red Team, Right Blue Team). If both teams are full, game begins. Enjoy!


http://ppep.io
Ppep.io is a really cool, pacman-style .io game! You collect mass as you would in agar.io, but your movements are restricted to up, down, left, right. Good luck!

The game itself is quite simple dispute being annoyingly tricky, your ball will continue to bounce as you move it however certain parts of terrain will cause your ball to bounce higher or lower. Like I already mentioned there are obstacles along the way which will end your run on contact such as spikes, lava and swinging balls, there may be more but I didn¡¯t have much lucky advancing when I played :P.



http://www.flar.io/
You start off with a single base and a small sum of cash, aim to slowly but surely expand putting multiple bases on the map, adding quarries to farm rocks for you and defend your borders with heaps of turrets. The awesome thing about this game is that the map is fairly small which means a whole lot of action. Like all strategy games the match lengths depend on the players, a game can last the full duration of about 50 minutes on occasions or force-ably make all your opponents quit with your decision making prowess! I don¡¯t play many strat games myself but Flario definitely made it easy to get in and enjoy within the first few minutes.
